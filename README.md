# Azure Cosmos DB Samples

## Installation

The project includes a Docker Compose file that allows you to run the Azure Cosmos Emulator within a Docker container. However, if your machine has limited memory and CPU resources, it is advisable to install the emulator directly on your operating system to achieve optimal performance. Running the emulator natively on your machine can help minimize resource consumption and provide a smoother experience when working with the emulator.
